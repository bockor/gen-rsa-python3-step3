Python3 Exercise Step 3
-----------------------
- Consider this repo as the starting point.

- Ensure that user input is verified :
	- p & q: must be integer and prime number
	- m : must be integer and less than the modulus

- Work with a "while" loop(s) until the user gets it right.

- You could fork this repo, clone it and then work on it locally on a new  "validate-user-input" branch to finally push the branch to your remote GitHub repo when finished.
