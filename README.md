Python3 Exercise Step 3
-----------------------
- Consider this repo as the starting point.

- Ensure that user input is verified :
	- p & q: must be integer and prime number
	- m : must be integer and less than the modulus

- Work with a "while" loop(s) until the user gets it right.  See the expectations.png screenshot.

- It is evident that the focus is the implementation of the python code but in the light to get a grip on Git collaboration framework one could:
	- Fork this repo 
	- Clone it to your local drive
	- Work on it locally on a new  "validate-user-input" branch
	- push the branch to your remote GitHub repo when finished.
